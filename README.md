# CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Explorer

##  Overview
The **CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Explorer** is a Python-based data analytics project that explores and visualizes global carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) emissions trends across countries and years.  
It provides meaningful insights into how different regions contribute to global emissions using **Python, Pandas, and data visualization tools**.

This project was developed as part of the **BACSE101 ‚Äì Problem Solving Using Python** course at **Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore**.

---

##  Project Objectives
- Analyze the **OWID (Our World in Data)** CO‚ÇÇ dataset.  
- Perform **data cleaning, aggregation, and filtering** using Pandas.  
- Visualize emissions trends across time and countries.  
- Derive key statistics such as total emissions, per-capita comparisons, and growth trends.

---

##  Dataset
**File:** `owid-co2-data.csv`  
**Source:** [Our World in Data - CO‚ÇÇ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

The dataset includes:
- Country and continent names  
- Yearly CO‚ÇÇ emissions  
- Per capita and cumulative emissions  
- Other related indicators

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **NumPy** ‚Äì numerical computations  
- **Pandas** ‚Äì data analysis and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** ‚Äì data visualization (depending on implementation)

##  How to Run the Project

### 1Ô∏è Install Dependencies
Make sure Python and Pip are installed.  
Then open your terminal (or CMD) and run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

### 2Ô∏è Run the Main Script
Execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3Ô∏è Expected Output
- The script reads the CO‚ÇÇ dataset (`owid-co2-data.csv`).  
- Performs statistical and comparative analysis.  
- Displays or saves visualizations (like line charts, bar plots, etc.)  
- Prints insights such as top emitting countries, trends over years, and emission growth.

##  Example Features (Typical Outputs)
-  Total CO‚ÇÇ emissions by continent  
-  Yearly trend analysis for selected countries  
-  Per capita CO‚ÇÇ comparison  
-  Global cumulative emissions visualization
