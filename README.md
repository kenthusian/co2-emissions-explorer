# CO₂ Emissions Explorer

##  Overview
The **CO₂ Emissions Explorer** is a Python-based data analytics project that explores and visualizes global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions trends across countries and years.  
It provides meaningful insights into how different regions contribute to global emissions using **Python, Pandas, and data visualization tools**.

This project was developed as part of the **BACSE101 – Problem Solving Using Python** course at **Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore**.

---

##  Project Objectives
- Analyze the **OWID (Our World in Data)** CO₂ dataset.  
- Perform **data cleaning, aggregation, and filtering** using Pandas.  
- Visualize emissions trends across time and countries.  
- Derive key statistics such as total emissions, per-capita comparisons, and growth trends.

---

##  Dataset
**File:** `owid-co2-data.csv`  
**Source:** [Our World in Data - CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

The dataset includes:
- Country and continent names  
- Yearly CO₂ emissions  
- Per capita and cumulative emissions  
- Other related indicators

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data analysis and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** – data visualization (depending on implementation)

##  How to Run the Project

### 1️ Install Dependencies
Make sure Python and Pip are installed.  
Then open your terminal (or CMD) and run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

### 2️ Run the Main Script
Execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3️ Expected Output
- The script reads the CO₂ dataset (`owid-co2-data.csv`).  
- Performs statistical and comparative analysis.  
- Displays or saves visualizations (like line charts, bar plots, etc.)  
- Prints insights such as top emitting countries, trends over years, and emission growth.

##  Example Features (Typical Outputs)
-  Total CO₂ emissions by continent  
-  Yearly trend analysis for selected countries  
-  Per capita CO₂ comparison  
-  Global cumulative emissions visualization

##  Sample Insights (Illustrative)
```
Top 5 CO₂ Emitting Countries in 2020:
1. China
2. United States
3. India
4. Russia
5. Japan

Average Global Emission Growth (2000–2020): +1.8% per year
```
